Commands that haven't made their way into roles' tasks yet.

- namenode formatting
  sudo -u hdfs hdfs namenode -format
  (from here on out, hdfs commands assume becoming hdfs by this or ansible means)

- namenode daemon launch

- datanode daemon launch

- hdfs /tmp dir creation
  hdfs dfs -mkdir /tmp
  hdfs dfs -chmod -R 1777 /tmp

- hdfs /user dir creation
  hdfs dfs -mkdir /user

- hdfs user setup
  hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/{{ user }}
  hdfs dfs -chown {{ user }} /user/{{ user }}
  hdfs dfsadmin -refreshUserToGroupMappings # didn't seem necessary

- hdfs /user/history dir creation
  (see mapred role)

- hdfs /var/log/hadoop-yarn dir creation
  hdfs dfs -mkdir -p {{ it's a yarn variable in group_vars/hadoop.yml }}
    note: no, it isn't quite; it needs '/apps' lopped off the end to be 2 variables
          1) sans /apps = what gets created here
          2) w/   /apps = what gets specified in the properties file
  hdfs dfs -chown yarn:mapred {{ what gets created }}

  note: mapred and yarn roles could be close to circular dependency
        mapred requires the yarn user to exist...
