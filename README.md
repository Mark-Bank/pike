A raspberry pi hadoop cluster

### status
I'm amassing notes as I manually stand things up. Eventually going to configure the cluster via ansible. This dummy branch is a capture of notes.

### philosophy
I'm going to take management of the toy cluster super seriously. Learn new tools and more about technologies I'm only user-level familiar with.
