motivation
  - to collect all the steps for provisioning raspberry pis that require human input

quantities
  - number of pis in a grid provisioning
  - number of grid provisionings (1? 2 max? 3 if we're insane? 4 if we perpetually get things horribly wrong?)
  - number of distinct OSes per grid (1? 2 max?)
  - number of distinct OSes across all grids provisioned (more likely to exceed 1, given we may experiment)

steps
  - os image retrieval
    (unlikely to be repeated per node; may be repeated across multiple grid provisionings)
  - flashcard configuration
    - local script with prompts; human needs to interact with the flashcard...
  - os basic configuration
    - including basic config changing like default language (the pis think we're Brits...)
    - including ssh configuration (e.g. defaults aren't _great_ ...)

  - kwas-sanctioned steps follow......

  * /etc/profile.d should contain things like 'java.sh' that export variables and such (because those scripts are run on start)
  - vim
  - tmux
  - hostname
  * sudo apt-get update # enables apt-cache search
  - java
    - apt-cache search oracle | grep jdk # yields oracle-java8-jdk
    - add JAVA_HOME... ( /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-8-oracle-arm32-vfp-hflt/jre (see java in /etc/alternatives)
  - hadoop
    - manually fetch the binary tar
    - scp to machine
    - untar
    - add bin dir to PATH
    ...
    - basic config like memory (256 MB?...) -- this happened to be in hadoop-env.sh
    - in core-site.xml, add:
      <property>   <name>fs.defaultFS</name>  <value>hdfs://localhost:8020</value>  </property>
    - hdfs namenode -format

todo now:
    

notes
  - the purpose of this should be a beeline to ssh configuration, no? that's the crack
    in the dam that allows all other configuration, even additional ssh configuration...
    so the default ssh config would work, and that can be enabled by dropping a file
    called 'ssh' into the boot partition of the micro sd card
  - then the rest of this "workspace" defining the "manual" setup could be journaling
    remaining steps that can be automated
  - what the end-goal of this segment should be (since the original--what's required in meatspace-- is defeated):
    the general setup for every pi
  - the setup fractures into specifics depending on the role of the particular pi being configured, but certainly
    all will have plenty of overlap to document and automate
  - still necessary: identifying all aspects of OS configuration, etc., that will need addressing here...
    - they'll all need practices established (e.g. how do we prefer to automate? -- probably anything that works is fine...)
