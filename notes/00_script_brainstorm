first line will have unset variable death (program should run with absolute path of os img)

then prompt... "The micro SD should not be in your machine yet.
                 ... is it in your machine? [y/n]
                  y -> eject it safely from your machine! (goes back to the question)
                  n -> gathering set of existing filesystems of local machine...
                       gathered:
                         // the output is the first "column" of df (sans the first line, the headers)
                         // the tricky issue: filesystem names can have spaces, so it's not an awk that grabs the first argument
                         // (Filesystem is the first title, then one or more spaces... then another title. The index of that second title is the alignment of all following rows' second columns.
                         //  ...... so, cut each line at that char, then remove the last element. All remaining elements are the filesystem name)

this output is sorted and stored in a temporary file descriptor, to be used in one moment...

another prompt: "Insert the micro SD into your machine, then press [ENTER] to proceed..."
                  [ENTER] -> gathering of the Filesystem names agin, just as before, storing them in a file descriptor sorted and reading them out

commm the 2 FDesc's to find differences in the sets.

warn if some went missing

warn if none new were detected.... : "No new filesystems detected. Are you sure you inserted that bad boy?
                                      To abort, enter [A/a]. Otherwise, after checking / reinserting, press [ENTER] (then it loops back...)

after new is detected, output all new.

Warn emphatically that they will be overwritten, and ask if ok [y/Y] to proceed
                  Y/y -> do overwrite, warning that it takes time and won't give readouts (oohhhh, could be fun to issue those SIGSTATUS signals or whatever, though)
                  anything else -> "abort? [y/n]
                     Y/y -> exit
                     N/n -> loop back to ok-to-proceed-with-overwrite bit
