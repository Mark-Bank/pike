# this is a log of the commands executed to install a Raspbian OS on a Raspberry Pi
# the os version: Raspbian Stretch Lite (release date: 2017-09-07 kernel version: 4.9)
# the pi version: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
# these instructions are compiled from the "Alternative method" section of https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md

# note: the image of raspbian stretch lite has already been retrieved, located at /Users/mark/workspaces/images/2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img

# note.... that `diskutil list` provides similar utility; it may be that an optimal-for-scripting method could be derived

[$] note all new elements under the Filesystem column, resulting from the flashdrive's insertion

# note that there might be more than just disk2s1 rocking..... not sure if it makes more sense to `sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2` to nab everything?
$ sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1 # final arg is each new element of the first column of the previous command's output
Password:
Volume NO NAME on disk2s1 unmounted

[$] note that the raw Filesystem name of the flashcard is any Filesystem name associated with it (each was used as the previous command's final arg) under this formatting function:
# /dev/disk#s# -> /dev/rdisk#
# (r prepends to last "directory", and trailing "s#" is truncated

$ OS_IMG="/Users/mark/workspaces/images/2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img"
$ sudo dd bs=1m if="${OS_IMG}" of=/dev/rdisk2 conv=sync # if equals the OS image; of euqals the name of the raw Filesystem of the flashdrive as determined from the previous comment

# that command may take 3 or so minutes, operating silently if no errors are thrown.
# entering ctrl+T while it executes retrieves info from the process.
# for example output, see below:

# now... for ssh... `df -h` or maybe `diskutil list` (with -plist for max programmability) yield the Filesystem and where it's mounted... Where it's mounted is important.
$ df -h # find the line with the correct disk in the 'Filesystem' column, then retrieve the path in the 'Mounted on'
$ mounted_on="/Volumes/boot"
$ touch "${mounted_on}"/ssh

$ sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk2
Disk /dev/rdisk2 ejected

[$] remove the micro sd card from the local machine
[$] insert micro sd card, hdmi cable, [usb mouse,] and usb keyboard into raspberry pi
[$] insert micro usb power supply into raspberry pi

[$] after the pi concludes the boot process, login at the prompt using these credentials: username=pi passowrd=raspberry
[$] (if this is a graphical ui os, the following command launches the gui: $ startx
