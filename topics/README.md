# meta - topics
The purpose of this branch is to explore ideas about the application and purpose of a raspberry pi cluster.

The structure will be a single branch off that initial master, with directories per meta topic. A README.md per meta topic will journal thoughts, with commits noting additions / changes.

Overblown much? Yes. But it's important to over-consider and under-deliver.
